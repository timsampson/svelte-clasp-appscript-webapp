# Google Appscript Webapp using Svelte, Rollup 2, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI and Svelte-Spa-Router

Svlete now has a default bundler of Vite, and since it uses a module system, which is not compatible with Gaps. So going forward, I am going to use this template with Rollup 2, so that I have a working template that doesn't require configuration each time.
